# githubEasy
This python script makes it easy to automate github uploads.

I recommend you to run it in a console but you can also just open it normally.

To automate the script even more, insert your username in the python script username variable (username = YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME).

You should use the same name for the project folder you want to upload as your repository or you can change the script to ask for the repository name as an input.
